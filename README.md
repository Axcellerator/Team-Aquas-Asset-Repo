# Team Aqua's Asset Repo

## What is Team Aqua's Asset Repo?

This is a collection of **_free to use_** assets that are intended to be used for Generation 3 Pokémon decomp hacking, initially created and managed by members of the [Team Aqua's Hideout](https://discord.gg/sNNCZxcXnA) Discord server.

## What sort of assets?
Anything and everything that might be of interest to romhackers! This includes but is not limited to:
- Music
- Sound effects
- Sprites
    - Overworld trainer / object / misc sprites
    - Trainer front / back sprites
    - Custom Pokémon sprites
- Tilesets
- User Interface elements
- Anything else!

## How is everything organized?
- First level folders are organized by **creator or project,** so individual creators have the easiest time maintaining and adding to their own body of work and crediting the appropriate people is easier.
- Second level folders, if they exist, are broadly organized by **asset type,** at the discretion of the contributor / maintainer (ie. Tilesets, Overworld Sprites, etc.)
- Any folder that includes an actual asset that is not **_exclusively_** the work of one individual **_must supply a README.md_** indicating:
    - The original creator(s) of an asset if it was part of a larger scale project
    - The original creator of an asset that has been modified in any way (recoloured / resized etc.)

Many folders containing assets will also include preview images of the assets. Note that these previews are likely to be a bit blurry in this form due to markdown stretching etc., so you'll have to open the files themselves in a better image viewer to see them in sharper resolution.

## What can I contribute?
Any assets you've made personally, or any assets you've found that are free to use, **_provided they are submitted alongside credit to their original creator._**

In addition to everything in the initial list, I want to specify that alterations on existing work are also welcome! This includes but is not limited to:
- Sprite recolours / resizes
- New interpretations of existing Pokémon sprites
- Riffs on existing Pokémon music
- Anything else!

Please remeber that if any of the work you submit is not entirely made by you from scratch, you must **_include credit to the original creator of your source material._**

# How can I submit assets?
There are two main ways of submitting assets, pull requests and Discord submissions. Pull requests are preferred if possible.

## Pull Requests
Fork this repository, and submit any assets you have / find / make as pull requests. Please ensure that you match the repository's organizational structure, and **_include README.md's crediting the original creators_** as applicable.

Please consider including preview images / soundbites of your assets in the README.md file, so repository users can enjoy all your work without having to open up every single file individually! 

A sample file, README_sample.md, has been provided for reference.

## Discord Submissions
Send your asset or a link to it to the appropriate channel in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/sNNCZxcXnA), and indicate that you'd like it added to the repository. One of the maintainers will add it the next time they're available to do so. Note that you must supply the following submission criteria:
- Original creator of the source material
- Your preferred username, if this is your asset / your edit / recolour / resize / etc.
- Type of asset (song, overworld sprite, trainer portrait, etc.)
