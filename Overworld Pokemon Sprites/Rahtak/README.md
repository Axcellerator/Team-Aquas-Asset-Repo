## Gen 1-8 overworld sprites for Merrp's follower system

Contents:
- Compilation of overworld sprites for most gen 1 to 8 (including PLA) Pok√©mons, formatted for Merrp's (https://github.com/aarant/pokeemerald) follower system.
- Palettes for the mons (Shiny pals not included mons after gen 7, most shiny pals are just duplicates of normal pal after Melmetal)

Missing:
- Many mons with a ton of forms such as Alcremie might be missing

Optional text file snippets from my own project:
- Spritesheet Makefile rules for most mons
- gObjectEventPic consts for object_event_graphics.h 
- object_event_graphics_info_followers.h configs and associated object_event_pic_tables.h structs 
- palette_table.h and shiny_palette_table.h 
- graphics.h for gFollowMonPalette and gFollowMonShinyPalette consts
- pokemon.h for pointing to follow palettes

If any of the sprites are broken or their palettes are broken, ping me on Discord (rahtak) and I will get around to fixing it
