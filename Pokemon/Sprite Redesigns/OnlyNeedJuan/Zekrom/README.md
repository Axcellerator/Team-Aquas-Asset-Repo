New shiny palette heavily inspired by Reshiram's normal palette. Otherwise, an edit of the pre-existing Zekrom sprite. 

My new sprite works with my new shiny palette, but if you prefer the vanilla shiny palette, you'll need to make some small changes. Use the palette file to match your preference.
